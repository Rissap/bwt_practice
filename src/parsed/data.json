It was gone for so long that it was substituted with the wooden litter and the more expensive brands of grit based litter. What I have learned is my cat hates the feel of the wooden pellets under his paws, I had to mix it in with the grit to get him to use his tray. This just works for me and my cat and it's a great price too."

These flavours are the best Felix has ever brought out i think according to my cat as she used to be addicted to Whiskers, and reluctantly ate a half pouch of all other cat foods until this, but this Felix As Good As It Looks is the winner.  She loves the flakes as its nice and finely shredded for her delicate teeth.  She loves the jelly she will not have gravy. \nWe rate these 100%!! "

Every morning I eagerly sit meowing at the bottom of the stairs waiting for my slave to wake from his slumber to feed me.  My meowing increases with excitement as he pulls open the drawer and reveals the pouch of meaty goodness.  As he rips back the packet, the delicious smell sends my whiskers into a frenzy and I dart eagerly over to my feeding station.  Carefully my slave squeezes the succulent meat in the glistening jelly into my bowl and mashes with his fork.  Like a lion (a distant ancestor none the less) feasting on a recently hunted gazelle, I gorge at the food savoring every moment of the meaty meal that is before me. All four flavours are equally delicious and set me up for my day of slumber and laziness. I lick the bowl clean every time as I hate to waste any of this tasty food. Purrfect, just purrfect!"

It's more  expensive than some brands but at least they eat all of it rather than my having to throw half their food onto the garden the following morning. (Sorry Tesco, but although they like the jelly in your pouches, they never eat the 'meaty' chunks, so I dread to think what goes into those chunks.) My only negative is that it is not free (haha) or cheaper, & I wish that there are more tastes to choose fro. I seem to recall that there once was Cod Savoury Cakes; what happened to that? Please bring that back? And how about Pilchards, Sardines & Prawns for example?  All in all, this food is a plus according to at least 4 of my 5 my cats. I have a suggestion for other cat owners too: Having washed my cats dishes, I then place them on the radiator to dry. This makes them quite hot by the time I take them off again, & warms them up nicely for their food & according to my vet, if their food is warmed up (not too much obviously) it becomes  immediately more palatable for the cats ^.^ :)"

She's tried all makers of cat food always eaten it until a year ago.  I tried her on all the big brands and at times she's looked up at me nose in the air again, then WHISKERS 11+ I thought would be ideal as she is over 11 and so i bought two boxes of 12 and what????  Up goes her nose again, when I put down the WHISKERS 'Turkey'!!! - she said \"WHAT OTHER DELICACIES IN THAT GORGEOUS BOX? NOW WHY HAVEN'T I HAD THESE BEFORE - IDIOT!!\" I was astounded she actually loves all four flavours of which she's had before from other manufacturers and just a few mouthsful then its had to be recycled,  Now she's in \"17th Heaven\", she loves them that she wakes me up around 3am for an extra pouch of her yummies.  Fluffy would recommend these 100%.  They're small cubes in jelly and she eats them easily no having to pull the food apart,  non stinky as some cat foods do, looks good enough for me to eat even.  Look out Fluffy!!!  The jelly is good, as its moisture, and as she wont always drink she at least gets plenty liquid from this wonderful Whiskers.  It contains a lot of great nutrients, vitamins, etc, for elderly cats, it is an ideal cat food. \n Do give your cat a treat if he or she is 11+ its great.  "

I don't know what to do now as nothing else works like the Ultra does, and my cats are not happy with anything else.  I have two Ragdoll Cats, they are large cats and use extra large litter boxes, which takes 2 x 10L bags for each.  I have been a regular loyal customer since your store opened way back, I spend a lot of money with you, and have my groceries delivered, but you constantly keep discontinuing popular products, which is frustrating and makes me feel angry.  I am disabled and can't shop for cat litter anywhere else because of the weight of it.  Please, Please! get it back! in stock!"

I rarely see her drink water, so these soups are a great idea! \n\nWould definitely buy these again as they went down such a hit. Only downside is that there isn't much meat in the sachet so we used this as more of a treat than an everyday meal. "

And you might be missing a trick with this treat as you can cut into one side of the treat and fit tablets in - then press them closed and she eats the pills with the treat. This makes treating my cat with medication so easy.  She really enjoys the flavour and doesn't notice the pill.  So glad I found this product."

She eats every little scrap leaving a clean dish (and nothing for the dog to scavenge later). The little cubes of meat or fish are just the right size for her fussy, 7 year old palate, all held together in a delicious (it must be as she eats everything) jelly. The combination is obviously 'purrr'fect and I will have no hesitation in buying this Felix Pouch Senior in Jelly Mixed Selection in the future. Also there must be something wonderful about the salmon flavour as my cat usually won't eat fish flavoured products - she's even fussy with real cooked fish! All I can say is well done Felix! This product is highly recommended by my cat, Mitzi!"

My cat can be a bit picky with food, particularly her meat so I love that this is a complete food. She immediately took to the biscuit and has keenly eaten it everyday since. Of the changes the 3 week challenge suggests I can't really comment on how it's improved her digestion, she's an outdoor cat so I don't really see her stool to know a change however the change in her fur and eyes is massive. She's only a young cat so she was in a good condition anyway but her fur is so much softer and glossier, I didn't believe a change in food could make this much difference. Her eyes are also very bright. If it can do this much to her in such a short time I'd like to think it will continue to keep her health and build her natural defense system. I definitely think Purina One has converted us! #Freebie"

The pack is easy to open and resealable, which is great as this helps to keep the product in tip top condition. \r\nThe food looks and smells high quality and I love the fact that it is all natural with no artificial ingredients. \r\nI introduced her to the food over a 7 day period so as not to upset her digestive system. She loves the tasty kibbles. I am hoping that it will help improve her coat, which has become a little tired and dull looking recently. So far I have not noticed a difference but it has only been a couple of weeks, I know that these things take time. \r\nI would recommend the food and would buy them again."

Well he adores it, he is wolfing it down.

Since feeding her this food there has been an amazing difference in her. Her coat is glossy and beautiful again! Her energy levels are up! And best of all, no more upset stomache issues!!\n\nMy other cat is more of a eat to live cat in comparison to my other live to eat lion cat. She is very picky about what she will and won't eat! Since trying them both on the Purina Sensitive she now refuses to eat anything else.\n\nMy cats love this food and the difference in them shows."

Recently, they had disappeared from the shelf at my local Tesco superstore. When they came back and I bought my usual amount, the cat wouldn\u2019t touch them. Same happen again, and after another box became available, I bought two packets for a try out. Cat ate them instantly. Next time I bought them, same scraping and complaining. \nMy cat is not wrong!

She loves fish.\r\n\r\nI started off giving them as treats now she can't get enough. Which I'm over the moon about as she needs a lil dental work so the dry biscuits will help so much. \r\n\r\nThe biscuits are a decent size not too big, but just enough crunch to clean the teeth and a decent size for her little mouth.\r\nThey smell of the ocean fish is actually quite good it's not over powering, asi dont like fish smell. It's not too oily either. \r\n\r\nIt's too soon to say if she has any health benefits yet, but if she carries on munching them up I'm sure I will find out soo  enough!\r\n\r\nHighly recommend the ocean fish  flavour it was by far her favourite, followed by the chicken flavour, my cat agrees too.

I tried a lot of the more expensive high protein dry cat food and hit bingo with Purina one. I have been using it now for nearly a year and each of them love it, I never have to throw any away and the underweight cat regained to a normal healthy weight, I also noticed a big difference in their fur, all four have lovely shiny coats. Economy wise I have saved on the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 due to not having to throw any away and they have never gone off it like they have with other foods in the past, so glad that I found this food as I was really worrying about the underweight cat. Thank you soon much Purina one."

Lester - our cat - was quite attracted to the smell of the biscuits and was very eager to try them. We started with a little amount and then mixed into his dry food so he could gradually switch to Iams. Impressive is the amount of protein the ocean fish flavour has, as we try to keep Lester's diet as much protein packed as possible. Given all that we still think that the best food for Lester is wet food, but cats have to have some dry biscuits to nibble on between the meals, and this one works for us."

She loves fish.\r\n\r\nI started off giving them as treats now she can't get enough. Which I'm over the moon about as she needs a lil dental work so the dry biscuits will help so much. \r\n\r\nThe biscuits are a decent size not too big, but just enough crunch to clean the teeth and a decent size for her little mouth.\r\nThey smell of the ocean fish is actually quite good it's not over powering, asi dont like fish smell. It's not too oily either. \r\n\r\nIt's too soon to say if she has any health benefits yet, but if she carries on munching them up I'm sure I will find out soo  enough!\r\n\r\nHighly recommend the ocean fish  flavour it was by far her favourite, followed by the chicken flavour, my cat agrees too.

I've also noticed she like to like around a lot of the other food pouches and packs often leaving the solid meat  bits even if I cut them up she'll only eat some of it so the pate in small amounts is a great idea for her. If your cat is having problems chewing, they'll need a teeth checkup anyway but these are soft and gentle to eat meanwhile when squished with a fork. "

Hence, I am always open to introduce to her new flavours of her favourite brands and to try new brands of cat food. The Purina One DualNature that we received is rich in chicken, one of Phoebe\u2019s favourite flavours. The new Purina One DualNature has taken my cat Phoebe immediately from the first day. I placed a few kibbles in her bowl and Yum, she immediately ate them, no fuss, no problem, and she was even asking for more. Phoebe likes the new dual texture of the kibbles, some crunchier and some softer, because she seems to chew easier. Like my food, I want my cat\u2019s food to be as natural as possible, no preservatives, no artificial colourants or flavouring, which Purina One DualNature delivers. Besides, spirulina, the blue-green algae that Purina One DualNature contains, supports a cat\u2019s immune system. Hence this might be the reason my cat is more alert and playful and even her fur looks healthier. By feeding my cat Purina One DualNature with high quality of healthy ingredients and protein, I support her healthy digestive tract and a healthy immune system. Purina One DualNature, rich in chicken, is our new dry food favourite and already on the shopping list."

When I opened it and put some in her dish, I held my breath and waited to see if she would eat it or reject it and to my relief she ate it with relish and after finishing it was looking for more. Since she has been having this complete her weight has increased and her skin and fur condition has improved. she looks forward to her meals now and a large bag seems to last forever, so is good value for money as well."

Hence, I am always open to introduce to her new flavours of her favourite brands and to try new brands of cat food. The Purina One DualNature that we received is rich in chicken, one of Phoebe\u2019s favourite flavours. The new Purina One DualNature has taken my cat Phoebe immediately from the first day. I placed a few kibbles in her bowl and Yum, she immediately ate them, no fuss, no problem, and she was even asking for more. Phoebe likes the new dual texture of the kibbles, some crunchier and some softer, because she seems to chew easier. Like my food, I want my cat\u2019s food to be as natural as possible, no preservatives, no artificial colourants or flavouring, which Purina One DualNature delivers. Besides, spirulina, the blue-green algae that Purina One DualNature contains, supports a cat\u2019s immune system. Hence this might be the reason my cat is more alert and playful and even her fur looks healthier. By feeding my cat Purina One DualNature with high quality of healthy ingredients and protein, I support her healthy digestive tract and a healthy immune system. Purina One DualNature, rich in chicken, is our new dry food favourite and already on the shopping list."

So we got the chicken pouch and our two cats adored it! They gobbled it up so greedily! It\u2019s evident from the appearance that it\u2019s made of good quality chicken (you can see the chicken, it\u2019s not reconstituted, and it\u2019s covered in a transparent jelly. It slid easily and cleanly out of the packet, but maintained its shape due to the jelly, which looked a bit unappetising to us humans but the cats went wild for it!

We took her to the vet many times and she had pain relief and anti inflammatories. We were at a loss as to what to feed her but everything seemed to contain too much fat. I saw your Light dry food at my online supermarket amd decided to try some. After approx 3 weeks she started to thrive again and she regained all her lost weight very quickly,and no longer resembles a skeleton. She is now like a kitten again and she has had no visits to the vet since. The difference in her seems like a miracle. I am confident this food will keep her illness at bay. THANK YOU SO MUCH."

Although she was ill and had numerous medical issues, many people 'thought' they were doing good by feeding her all sorts - she became very overweight. The vet gave us all sorts to try but nothing worked - she kept gaining weight! we tried her on a strict Purina Light diet (as Purina has helped many of our cats previously) and she finally began losing weight PLUS she loves it. We will never change from Purina now, it does what it says on the tin and helped her gain more strength and coat vitality. I love this product and it's worth every penny. Theres no point taking an animal on if you are going to buy rubbish food. I believe this product has saved her and now she won't have any weight gain issues in the future on top of her other medical issues. Thanks Purina :-) Here she is - VERY happy and healthy at last."

Tesco seem to have stopped selling the best cat litter which was the ultra clumping, after only stocking it sporadically.  This stuff claims to clump but does so badly and claims odour control but, also, does that badly, or rather, not at all. The floor is covered every time the cat uses her tray. Trying a different litter from a different shop next."
