Today I have used a sheet at the bottom of my tub in the fridge with freshly washed spinach in, with a sheet on the top it soaks up any excess water and the spinach lasts a week rather than a couple of days in a plastic bag! plenty is always in my cupboard. My definite go to and a household essential."

Of course none of the kids spill anything so if you was to ask them they would say I'm a liar.

                    "text": "Two stand-out points about Ora - it can be used one-handed and it's VERY long lasting. Why it lasts longer than an average kitchen roll is because every sheet is separate, so no tearing off two or three sheets at a time for tasks that probably require much less. I started my first pack of Ora about a week before Christmas and it lasted until around the start of the third week in January. I reckon this is twice as good as my regular kitchen roll. Concerned that Ora's circular sheets may not be as useful? - don't be. There's only one job I found they didn't work on - turning home made granola out onto from baking trays to cool and remove some of the grease. I probably make granola once a month. Otherwise this is equal in quality to my regular kitchen roll - but much more economical. A lot of thought's obviously gone into this product - the small cone it's dispensed from is fully biodegradable too.     "
