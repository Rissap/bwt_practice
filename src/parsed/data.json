But they have a major flaw  - yes they're 3 ply, soft & large BUT firstly when you open the box, they look as if they've been stuffed in as they're not flat like the other type but crumpled.  The bigger issue tho is that they fall apart the minute you've pulled them out of the box - so instead of 3 ply sometimes you find yourself left using 1 or 2 as you struggle to keep them together to use.  I've now tried 3 different boxes from 2 different outlets & they're all the same.\n\nHowever, I've bought these during the pandemic lockdown when everything is affected to one degree or another  so accept that perhaps it's just been a manufacturing issue at present under the current restrictions or maybe we've just had bad batches sent here.  I hope so, as I'd be very happy otherwise.  But for now - stick to the basic 3 ply boxes & leave these alone unless there's absolutely nothing else to buy :(   Would be useful to know if others find the same problem."

Why it lasts longer than an average kitchen roll is because every sheet is separate, so no tearing off two or three sheets at a time for tasks that probably require much less. I started my first pack of Ora about a week before Christmas and it lasted until around the start of the third week in January. I reckon this is twice as good as my regular kitchen roll. Concerned that Ora's circular sheets may not be as useful? - don't be. There's only one job I found they didn't work on - turning home made granola out onto from baking trays to cool and remove some of the grease. I probably make granola once a month. Otherwise this is equal in quality to my regular kitchen roll - but much more economical. A lot of thought's obviously gone into this product - the small cone it's dispensed from is fully biodegradable too.     "
